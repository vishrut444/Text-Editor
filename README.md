# Text-Editor
The project involves building a text editor in Java, using Java Swing for creating a graphical user interface.
The text editor will have a window (frame) with a menu bar, consisting of two menus - file menu and edit menu.
The file menu will have features like new window, save file and open file.
The edit menu will have five functions - Cut, Copy, Paste, select All and Close button.
The text area inside the window will be used for writing and editing the text.
The project demo shows a simple text editor created using Java Swing, with two menus (file and edit) and multiple features within each menu.
Users can write and edit text inside the text area.
